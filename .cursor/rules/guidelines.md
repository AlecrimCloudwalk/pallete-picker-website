# Color Palette Analyzer Website Guidelines

## Project Overview
This is a local web application that analyzes images to extract and display color information. The application will help users understand the color composition of their images by showing the most used colors and their percentages.

## Development Process
1. Checklist Iteration (MANDATORY)
   - Review and update the checklist at the start of each development session
   - Mark completed items and add new requirements as they arise
   - Use the checklist to track progress and plan next steps
   - Document any deviations or new features in the checklist
   - Update completion status of existing items

## Core Features
1. Image Upload
   - Users can upload images through a web interface
   - Support for common image formats (JPG, PNG, etc.)

2. Color Analysis
   - Extract colors from the uploaded image
   - Calculate color usage percentages
   - Group similar colors based on a user-adjustable threshold
   - Sort colors by usage percentage

3. Visualization
   - Display a horizontal bar chart
   - Each segment represents a color or color group
   - Segment width corresponds to usage percentage
   - Show percentage values for each color/group
   - Interactive threshold control for color grouping

## Technical Requirements
- Local hosting (no external dependencies)
- Modern web interface
- Efficient color analysis algorithm
- Responsive design
- Clear and intuitive user interface
- Dynamic color grouping threshold control

## User Flow
1. User visits the website
2. Uploads an image through the interface
3. Adjusts color grouping threshold if needed
4. Clicks an "Analyze" button
5. System processes the image
6. Displays the color analysis bar chart
7. Shows percentage breakdown for each color/group

## Design Philosophy
- Clean and minimal interface
- Focus on the color analysis visualization
- Intuitive user interaction
- Fast and efficient processing
- Clear presentation of results
- Interactive controls for customization
